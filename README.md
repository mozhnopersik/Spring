# Spring
It's my sixth app :)

### Description:
The Spring framework has been added to this app, and it demonstrates several different animations when clicking on the corresponding button. Not that itâ€™s very useful, but it's funny :)

### The task was:
Using the Spring framework and test animations from it.
